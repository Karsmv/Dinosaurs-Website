The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit, called the hallux, was short and did not reach the ground. The third digit was longer than the rest. Albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14–21 km/hour (8–13 mi/hour).[32] At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.",

The holotype skull lacks a crest in almost its entirety, however, the top surfaces of the fused parietal and frontal bones indicate that it likely had a well-developed crest, supported by the nasal and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the rostrum.

Walker. Baryonyx had a large number of finely serrated, conical teeth, with the largest teeth in front. The neck formed an S-shape, and the neural spines of its dorsal vertebrae increased in height from front to back. One elongated neural spine indicates it may have had a hump or ridge along the centre of its back. It had robust forelimbs, with the eponymous first-finger claw measuring about 31 centimetres (12 inches) long.",
        "secondParagraph": " Baryonyx was the first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile iguanodontid. The creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. Baryonyx may have had semiaquatic habits, and coexisted with other theropod, ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs, as well as pterosaurs, crocodiles, turtles and fishes, in a fluvial environment."

Another feature of the appearance of the ankylosaurus is thick armor made of bumps, bone plates and spikes. They grew into the skin and reliably protected the dinosaur from the claws and fangs of predators. Scientists believe that each ankylosaurus had plates on its back that formed unique patterns by which it could be distinguished like a human by facial features and lines on its arms.",
      "secondParagraph":"Even with teeth as sharp as knives, many predators could not bite through the bone plates of an ankylosaurus. The dinosaur turned sideways to the enemy, and he ran into sharp spikes. And with one blow of the tail-mace, the ankylosaurus could knock down, break bones and damage internal organs. With such a serious defense, the dinosaur made it clear to the attacking predators that they were unlikely to be able to dine. Ankylosaurus could deftly control the bone growth on the tail, lifting it into the air and swinging it in different directions.",

Brachiosaurs ate only plants and had to consume huge amounts of food in order to provide the necessary energy for their giant body. As a result, they apparently left behind huge piles of litter. Probably, brachiosaurs lived in families or groups of up to 20 individuals. Paleontologists draw this conclusion based on the many fossilized footprints of brachiosaurs.",
        "secondParagraph":"Carnivorous dinosaurs (for example, allosaurs) constantly roamed around, who were not averse to having lunch on brachiosaurus meat. In the face of mortal danger, the clumsy brachiosaurus could well try to crush the attacking predator by unleashing a powerful blow from its long tail on it. With luck, the brachiosaurus could well have defeated the predator before it had time to grab one of the cubs. Newly hatched brachiosaurs were tiny compared to their parents; in all likelihood, the skin of the cubs was soft, but with age it hardened and became covered with scales. Obviously, when moving, brachiosaurs had to keep their limbs fully extended. The body was so massive that the bones could crack under its enormous weight if he bent his legs just a little.",

Hadrosaurs are the largest of the hadrosaurids, with larger specimens reaching up to 12 meters. called duck-billed dinosaurs. But they are called so for the shape of their head, and not because they led a floating duck lifestyle.  The front part of their skull expanded, forming a wide duck's beak, with which the lizard tore off leaves and cones. In the back of the mouth, behind the beak, there was a row of cheek teeth, consisting of several thousand units, combined in vertical rows. Such an arrangement of jaws allowed the anatosaurus to chew the coarsest plant materials in its cheek pouches and eat foliage, needles, cones and branches from trees of any species that grew in the tropical forests where the animals lived.",

At first, Marsh suggested that the Stegosaurus walked on two legs. After careful study and assembly of the skeleton, it was found that he walked on four legs and had two rows of characteristic protruding bone plates along the ridge. The plates were not outgrowths of the main bones of the skeleton, but were located separately, probably performing the functions of protection from predators. Having a rich network of blood vessels, the plates could be painted in bright colors, playing a role in attracting individuals of the opposite sex. Four powerful spikes (up to 1 m long) on the tail also served as a defense weapon against attack.",

Most likely, the lizards swallowed stones to grind the vegetation in the stomach, following the example of modern birds and crocodiles.

With a large bony collar, three horns on its snout, large thick limbs, and a rhinoceros-like build, Triceratops are among the most recognizable dinosaurs. Possibly the most dangerous predator of the time, Tyrannosaurus Rex could prey on Triceratops, but it is not clear if they could fight each other, as is often portrayed.",
        "secondParagraph":"Triceratops horns were mainly used to fend off predators, but they also had other uses. It is not difficult to guess what else they might be needed for. The male who wins most of the fights drives away rivals and becomes the leader of the herd - until he has to fight for his leadership again. Triceratops, like deer, could lead a herd life, since the bones of many individuals were found in one place, and millions of years ago, male Triceratops could also fight for the place of the leader of the herd. Like modern deer, they could compete for females.",

This is due to the fact that the remains found for all the time are a complete skull and other fragments of the head part. Therefore, the previous range of estimates was enormous: from 3 to 12 meters. Only after the discovery of the remains of dracorex and stygimoloch did the anatomy of the animal become more or less clear. The most recent length estimates based on the latter are about 4.5 m. He moved on two legs. The forelimbs were small, but sufficiently developed. With them, he held the bushes or even collected fruits.",
        "secondParagraph":"Now let's turn to the most intriguing area of the pachycephalosaurus: the domed skull, decorated in the occipital and nasal parts with bony horn-like outgrowths. They were blunt, therefore they were a common decoration. The thickness of the dome itself reached 25 centimeters! What was the purpose of such an impressive tool, reliably protecting the small brain of a dinosaur? Option one: it is assumed that the mating season of these animals was especially spectacular, when the males first flaunted headdresses with various bone growths, and then literally beat their heads for females. Thick skulls easily withstood such a load. But, like modern animals, it was more of a showy-ceremonial nature, and usually everything ended without serious injuries. Option two: protection from small and medium sized predators.",

Evgeny Maleev named the new dinosaur in 1954, and other Therizinosaurus bones were discovered in subsequent years.
